# ds_2024_module_6_python_APIs
In this Python visualization module, created a Python script to visualize the weather over 500 citites of varying distances from the equator. Using python library and using WeatherMap API created a representative model of weather across cities.
Generated a random geographic coordiantes and the nearest city to each latitude and longitude combination is provided.
Using Open Weather Map API to retrieve weather data from the cities list generated, created scatter plots for latitude vs temperature, latitude vs Humidity, Latitude vs Cloudiness, Latitude vs Wind Speed. Computed linear regression plots to show eash relatioships and seperate the plots for Northeren Hemisphere and Southeren Hemisphere to describe the relationship and correlation slope on each categories.
 Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

In the second part of the module connceted to Geoapify API to to create coordinates data for each city created. Created map visual to show the humidity in each city. Created a new DataFrame hotel_df to store city, country, coordinates, and humidity. Created an another map to show each city vs humidity, on  tooltip showed additional info on hovering each city bubble on a map visual.
